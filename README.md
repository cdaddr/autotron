# autotron

A simulator of a Magic: The Gathering Deck.  AKA the nerdiest thing I've ever produced.

This program simulates a one-sided MTG game with the goal of getting one of each Tron land onto the battlefield as quickly as possible.  By simulating a large number of games, useful statistics can be produced.
